Features:
---------

- Unify ValueHandler/Value with single selector that can take any of them
- Movement targets should be redefinable
- Replace ranges used for random number generation with a "ValueSelector", which allows a literal, a range and a ValueHandler/Variable. The range can also use ValueHandler/Variable for the limits.
- Change numbers in most definitions (conditions, for example) by something that can be either a ValueHandler, a Variable, a literal, or a function, with a property drawer, etc
- Add HueShift/Outline effect for sprites
- Added debug system to Okapi
  - Enable debug system for nodes 
  - Debug is just logging to the console what's happening in terms of triggers
    and actions
- Tagged variables with search for variables beneath an object, etc...
- Conditions that can have visual support and interfaces on scene view should be created
- Add Network Object support to Okapi
- Add target to ActionSetParent (need rename of variables)
- Spawner with boxes should have options for direction
- Spawner should have random direction possibility
- Path shows direction (debug)
- Target can be collision object (being able to damage another object when there is a collision, for example)
- Bool and string variables
- Probes:
  - Circle
  - Box
- Comment Code
- Documentation

Usability:
----------
- Warning: when a button name is not defined (or doesn't exist, if possible)
- Warning: destroy action should be the last
- How to make simple actions more accessible? (see Simple Usage)
- Add a tree view to explore objects in the games
  - Add triggers/actions directly in the objects
  - Have the ability to have custom adds (SetVisibility, SetVelocity, etc)
- Add node ID property to actions/triggers

Simple usage:
-------------
- Maybe create a wizard?
- Set object visible/invisible
- Set object velocity

Videos:
-------
- Ricochet bullet
- Look at player

Bugs:
-----
- Preserve gravity with velocity set (?)
- Tooltips don't work with Naughty Attributes range
  - Maybe make my own to be able to have tooltips, or propose a fix
- Inertia on Movement_XY should only appear when Input control
- There's a strange bug with bounding boxes spawner, need to check it out (Breno project)
- Target tag on Shake should disappear when an object is set
- Shake should be linked to target, not to action itself (can't destroy action after a shake)
- Shake should return object to initial state (or have option for it)
- Blink doesn't check for lack of renderer
- Blink doesn't say nothing on description about on/off duration
- Limits should disappear on a variable when the limits are turned off
- When there's only one scene, we can't select it properly on ChangeScene action
- SetParameter action is having issues detecting an animation parameter

Polish:
-------
- Rounded corners on title boxes

Games:
------
- Add sounds to most games
- Add animations to Commando game
- Create FlagCatcher game
- Create UI game (strategy, need to think about this a lot)
- Create SpyGame (add AI system - StateMachine)
- Create Commando 2 game (add AI system - 2d path finding)
- Create Visual Novel game
- Convert probe thing to racing game with probe based AI

Ideas Okapi V2.0:
-----------------

- All objects that are "Okapi" objects have a "OkapiObject" component, with a scriptable object that belongs to them and has all the Okapi stuff in it
- Add node-based programming
- Packages that support types of system/games:
  - Inventory
  - Dialogues
  - AI
  - Visual Novel
- Ability to export OkapiKit game as a text file - for research purposes
